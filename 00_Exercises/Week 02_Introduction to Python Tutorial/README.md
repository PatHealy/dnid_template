## Introduction to Python Tutorial

Across three brief exercises, this tutorial is meant to review a few things you should already know how to do in Python (or in another language, if you happened to come in without any Python experience), cover a few python packages you should make sure you have installed, and introduce two essential tools we'll be using throughout Unit 1: Jupyter Notebooks and Streamlit.

#### hello_world.py

This file has three brief exercises to demonstrate your understanding of lists and dictionaries. You should be able to run it as you would any normal Python file (for example, from a terminal: `python hello_world.py`).

#### movie_data.ipynb

This is a Jupyter notebook file that will go through using pandas to perform some data analytics on the included `diary.csv` data. It's broken into four simple exercises.

### movie_data_streamlit.py

This is a python file that is meant to be run with Streamlit, a package to deploy simple python data visualizations as web pages. It contains two open-ended exercises using the included `diary.csv` data. 

To run this file, you'll need to run it as a streamlit file in terminal with `streamlit run movie_data_streamlit.py`
