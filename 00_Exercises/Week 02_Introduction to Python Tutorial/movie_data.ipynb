    "- Your data should be presented in sorted order, sorted by year. You can sort a pandas series with either the `sort_value()` or `sort_index()` methods. Experiment with them to see which is appropriate.\n",
    "- You can make a simple line graph out of any pandas series with the `.plot()` method ([documentation here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.html)). For this exercise, you can call it done when you reach this simple line graph but if you'd like to explore ploting in a more stylish way (maybe adding a title, axis labels, changing around the color theme), [check out this documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13.1/visualization.html).\n"
